This repository will get you started with building a quote bot in Python. It's meant to be used along with the [Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com) intro to Python.

When complete, you'll be able to grab random quotes from the command line, like this:

> **$** python get-quote.py
> 
> Keep it logically awesome
> 
> **$** python get-quote.py
